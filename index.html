     <h2>Fiction</h2>
     <h3>Analysis of Fiction Piece</h3>
     <p>The story starts light-hearted but turns suspenseful, highlighting Jacob's transformation from excitement to terror to resilience. Themes of survival, nature’s unpredictability, and personal growth come alive. Character development is strong, especially in the high-stakes climax against the shark.</p>

     <h3>Story: Jacob’s Beach Trip</h3>
     <p>Jacob had been dreaming of this beach trip for months. With the wind in his hair and the sun warming his face, he hit the open road, the sound of waves crashing in his mind. As he traveled down coastal highways lined with palm trees, he relished the thought of relaxing in the sun. However, his joy quickly turned to panic when he realized that he left behind his phone charger and most importantly, his beach gear. Still, he pressed on, determined to enjoy his day at the shore despite the setback.</p>

     <p>Once Jacob finally arrived at the beach, the beauty of the sparkling ocean and the soft sand was intoxicating. He stripped down to his swim trunks and rushed into the water, exhilarated by the rush of the salty waves. However, that joy turned into horror as a shadow loomed beneath the surface. Before he could react, a shark lunged toward him, its powerful jaws snapping dangerously close. Panic surged through him as he fought valiantly, battling the creature in a desperate struggle for survival.</p>

     <p>In a frantic mix of instinct and adrenaline, Jacob used his strength and determination to fend the shark off, grappling with it until it finally retreated into the depths. But the battle left him exhausted, his energy drained and vision fading. As the ocean rocked his body, he succumbed to unconsciousness, sinking beneath the water’s surface.</p>

     <p>When Jacob awoke, he found himself washed ashore, the sun setting on the horizon. Disoriented but alive, he realized he needed to get help. With the last of his strength, he crafted a large SOS sign from driftwood and seaweed. As he lay on the beach waiting for rescue, hope flooded back into him when he spotted a plane overhead. Waving his arms and shouting, he felt a surge of relief as the plane circled back, signaling that help was on the way. Jacob learned that from every battle—even one against the fiercest predator—there was a story of survival waiting to be told.</p>

     <h2>Personal Pride</h2>
     <h3>Essay: A Psychological Analysis of Parental Love in <em>The Giving Tree</em></h3>
     <p>A story can be interpreted in various ways. The observer can fit the narrative with their idiosyncratic characteristics, creating a message only they can comprehend. In Shel Silverstein's <em>The Giving Tree</em> it offers an exploration of selfless love and sacrifice. Analyzing the relationship between the tree and the boy through a psychological lens reveals the mother’s love and the development of the child's needs.</p>

     <p>From the beginning, the tree provides everything the boy needs—shade, apples, and branches—without hesitation. This mirrors a mother's role in the early stages of a child's life, where a child relies on her for comfort and support. Psychologist John Bowlby’s attachment theory explains that a strong emotional bond between mother and child is essential for the kid’s growth through childhood as the kid develops life skills that will help him or her through the rest of their life. The tree’s constant giving reflects a secure attachment bond, when the boy assumes that no matter what, his needs will be fulfilled without reciprocation.</p>

     <p>As the boy grew, his demands turned into physical needs. He no longer wanted comfort but now wanted material gain: apples to sell, branches to build a house, and the trunk of the tree for a canoe. The shift is a child's transition from dependence to self-sufficiency. The tree, much like a mother, continues to give without reciprocation even at the cost of losing herself. This is the reality for many mothers when they give and give, even if it depletes them physically and emotionally.</p>

     <p>While unconditional love is idealized, <em>The Giving Tree</em> also highlights the negative. The ultimate sacrifice, the tree offering everything till only the stump remains. In psychological terms, this aligns with the concept of emotional burnout. His return as an old man, seeking only a place to rest, the boy’s final reunion with the tree serves as a metaphor for the nature of a dependent relationship.</p>

     <p>Through a psychological lens, <em>The Giving Tree</em> serves as an allegory for a mother's unconditional love. The tree's sacrifice mirrors the devotion that mothers exhibit. However, the story also raises questions if this type of relationship between mother and kid is sustainable with these types of boundaries. <em>The Giving Tree</em> shows love as beautiful and complex, showing the depth of an unhealthy bond.</p>
